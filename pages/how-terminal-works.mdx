# How Terminal works

Dspread Terminal deployment consists of four main components:

* Your mobile payment app
* Your backend
* Dspread pos terminal
* Dspread pos SDK

The SDK facilitates communication between your payment application and terminal so you can accept in-person card payments and Tap to Pay iPhone and android devices.

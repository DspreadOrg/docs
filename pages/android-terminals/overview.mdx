## SDK Compatibility for Smart Terminals and mPOS Terminals

Our single SDK seamlessly supports both smart terminals and mPOS terminals, with varying operational prototypes.

* **Smart POS**: These are highly integrated devices, allowing developers to run their apps directly on the terminal.

* **mPOS**: These terminals require connectivity with a merchant's smartphone via Bluetooth or USB to function.

Despite these operational differences, the SDK remains consistent across both types. Please see detailed implementation for different terminal types in our [Accept Card Payment](/android-terminals/accept-card-payment) guide.
